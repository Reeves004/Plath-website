        <section class="legacy-summary">
            <p>Sylvia Plath was more than a poet. More than a novelist. More than a mother, a wife, a tragedy. She was a storm that refuses to pass, an ember that refuses to die out. Her voice echoes through time, in the ink of young poets, in the struggles of the unseen, in the restless minds of those who refuse to conform. This is her legacy—a haunting, a revolution, a testament to the power of words.</p>
