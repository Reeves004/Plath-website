                <h2>1932 - 1963</h2>
                <p>Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Sylvia Plath was a literary prodigy from an early age. Her words carried a weight beyond her years, filled with a fire that burned through convention. She wrote her first poem at age 8 and had her work published in newspapers by 10.</p>
                <p>Plath’s childhood was marked by the early loss of her father, an event that would haunt her poetry. She excelled academically, earning a scholarship to Smith College, where she honed her craft. However, beneath the surface, she battled severe depression, a struggle that seeped into her literary genius.</p>
                <p>Her only novel, <i>The Bell Jar</i>, became a haunting semi-autobiographical account of her descent into mental illness. But it was her poetry—raw, unfiltered, and unrelenting—that cemented her as one of the most influential voices in literature.</p>
