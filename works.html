                <h2>POETRY</h2>
                <p>Plath's poetry was raw, relentless, and revolutionary. From the delicate grief of The Colossus to the searing fury of Ariel, her words burn and haunt.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Colossus</strong> (1960)</li>
                    <li><strong>Ariel</strong> (1965, posthumous)</li>
                    <li><strong>Winter Trees</strong> (1971, posthumous)</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>“Out of the ash I rise with my red hair, and I eat men like air.”</blockquote>

                <h2>PROSE</h2>
                <p>The Bell Jar—her only novel, a semi-autobiographical descent into the psyche of a woman on the edge. A mirror to Plath’s own struggles, unflinching and devastating.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Bell Jar</strong> (1963)</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>“I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: I am, I am, I am.”</blockquote>

                <h2>PERSONAL WRITINGS</h2>
                <p>Her journals and letters reveal the unfiltered brilliance of her mind. Personal, unguarded, and often prophetic.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Unabridged Journals</strong> (2000)</li>
                    <li><strong>Letters Home</strong> (1975)</li>

            <p>Sylvia Plath’s work is not just literature; it is an experience. Her poetry, like a pulse in the dark, beats with an urgency that transcends time. *The Bell Jar* remains one of the most intimate portrayals of mental illness ever written. Her journals and letters offer us an unfiltered look into the brilliance and turmoil of a mind that burned too bright, too fast. Decades later, her words remain unshaken—unyielding, unforgotten.</p>
